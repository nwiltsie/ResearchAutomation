# Data Processing Pipelines

## Task

Given the race times in `./data/2021-02-18-data.csv`, plot lap and split plots for each racer, as well as a single consolidated plot.

Available processing scripts are in `./scripts/` (they only use the standard library):

* `print_racer_names.py`
* `extract_racer_data.py`
* `clean_racer_data.py`
* `merge_racer_data.py`
* `plot_data.py`
