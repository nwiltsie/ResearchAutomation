# Accelerating Research with Automation (Day 3)

Nick Wiltsie, January 2025

---

## Day Three - Extra Thoughts

- The Leftover Principle
- Ethics
- Version control
- Collaborative problem solving

---

## The Leftover Principle

"Isn't it beautiful? We have no idea how it works."

- [Automation Should Be Like Iron Man, Not Ultron](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2841313)

  - Automations should _enhance_ you, not replace you
  - Collaboration - you are able to step in when things go wrong

- Deskilling

  - Example: Self-driving cars

## Ethics

**You are responsible for what your automations do.**

- Individual level
  - Terms and conditions
  - `robots.txt`
- Societal level

<!-- Turned down jobs making weapons
What if everyone acted like you?
Intellectual property has real value
Right-to-repair laws -->

## Automation Gone Wrong

- Resumes with "Black" names
  - "We find that the [Massive Text Embedding models] are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1% of cases... Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100% of cases..."
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20371
- Predictive policing
  - "Our results suggest that differential crime reporting rates can lead to a displacement of predicted hotspots from high crime but low reporting areas to high or medium crime and high reporting areas."
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00128

<!-- Both of these use some form of big data, allowing human biases to creep in -->

---

## Version Control

- USE VERSION CONTROL
  - Use regression and unit tests, unit tests
  - Keep a changelog
- If you can't repeat it, it didn't happen (in a computing context)
  - Jupyter Notebook: `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...`
